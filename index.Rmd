</br>

Species conservation is a multi-faceted challenge that requires effort from people with skillsets ranging from applied ecology, economics, social sciences, data science, and biogeography to name only a few. For the efforts of this community to succeed, the evidence that is being used to inform conservation decisions must be accurate and reliable. UBC Okanagan's Quantitative Ecology Lab is focused on supporting the statistically efficient integration of data into ecological theory and conservation initiatives. To this end, the lab's work follows a step-wise process of methods development, testing, refinement, and application structured around two separate, but complimentary lines of research. The first falls under an umbrella called 'Biology or bias', and is aimed at understanding when/why different statistical approaches lead to differing conclusions, and how to avoid estimation bias. The second focuses on macro-ecology and global conservation by pairing high quality data with cutting edge analytical tools.

## Biology or Bias

Technological advances are transforming ecology as a field. Ecologists are now in a position to collect more accurate data for a larger number of species and individuals, and in more ecosystems than ever before. Problematically, however, statistical techniques for analysing these new and challenging datasets often lag behind. Worse, pairing these data with conventional statistical tools can lead to biased and potentially misleading results. With these issues in mind, the Quantitative Ecology Lab aims to bridge the gap between technological advances and practical ecology. Using carefully tailored experiments, we aim to clarify when analyses will work, when they should be avoided, what conditions cause them to fail, and to what extent that failure might be. This work provides researchers with the novel tools and practical guidelines needed to reliably answer ecological and conservation relevant questions from challenging and nuanced datasets.

## Macro-ecology and Global Conservation

The Quantitative Ecology lab has established an international team, comprised of >80 of the world’s leading movement ecologists. Through this network of specialists, we have built one of the largest animal tracking dataset ever assembled, consisting of 1300 individuals representing 76 mammalian and avian species. With the average, all-in cost of tracking an animal being [∼$9,500](https://doi.org/10.1071/WR10211), this dataset can be valued at >$11 million. Collectively this unprecedented dataset, and broad pool of expert knowledge make our team uniquely positioned to support global conservation efforts. Our lab uses these data to answer questions about the evolutionary history and function of key aspects of animal movement. We then use these higher level findings to contextualise species' responses to human induced rapid environmental change (HIREC), and provide actionable findings for species conservation.

There are currently no open positions for which we are actively recruiting. However, if you're interested in joining the Quantitative Ecology Lab, you are welcome to email us your CV, unofficial transcripts, a brief blurb about yourself and your interests, and what aspects of the lab's research interest you.

</br>

__General guidelines for prospective students__:
We expect prospective students to have consulted the general information provided at the Biology Graduate program webpage prior to contacting me.  Students in the Quantitative Ecology Lab gain valuable experience in quantitative methods, data management / analysis, `R` usage, and `R` package development.  These skills and experiences are aimed at helping our students find full time employment and / or further their academic careers.

</br>

Prospective students are encouraged to seek their own sources of external funding (e.g. NSERC), and to be competitive for internal grants available at UBC.
